## 2023 AoC edition

### 2023-12-22 Mozilla FireFox update

- Reviewers at Mozilla had requested we'd remove [the MomentJS workaround](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-charts/commit/6ea4669fe5588629e110db055313b9c772ba8331) we needed thus far, and it was possible since ChartJS had received updates in the past it seems. So we did a FireFox-only release to patch this
